How hard can this be?\nThis is the first in a series of Norseman workouts and is a classic threshold session with a twist. Each 9 minute threshold effort includes a 45 second burst at high intensity at the start and 4.5 minute mark. This session should be moderately strenuous and work your muscular endurance without costing you too much in terms of recovery time.\n\tThink you have what it takes?

The full training plan is exclusive to RCC members and will keep you fit and firing, and can even give you some gains on top.\n\nThis session is a 'Sustained Low Intensity Torque' (SLIT) Session, which requires you to pedal at a low cadence (60rpm) for a prolonged period of time (40 minutes) at 78% of your FTP (lower end of Zone 3). Pedaling at this low cadence, while still producing good power forces you to create a lot of crank torque, which recruits plenty of muscle fibers and helps you focus on improving your pedaling technique. A great session for developing your Strength Endurance.  \n\nERG mode is recommended.",

For most Time Trials, climbs or any sort of effort longer than 10 Minutes, your Lactate Threshold / Functional Threshold Power (FTP) is closely correlated to performance. By riding a little bit over threshold, then a little bit below threshold, we train our body to be more efficient at riding with lactic acid in our legs, which importantly improves our Lactate Tolerance and our FTP. In this session we complete 2 x 15 minute blocks of 30 seconds Over @ 105%FTP - 1 minute Under @ 95% FTP.

In mountain biking, to get up a short steep climb, or to get through some mud or over roots, the best way is to do it quickly - lots of power for a short period of time.\n\nThis session gets our anaerobic energy systems firing, as we make repeated 30 second efforts at 170% of FTP, simulating those short spikes in effort to get up a steep bank or through a technical part of the course. \n\nDon't be discouraged if your power drops throughout the blocks. You'll burn a lot of matches as you progress through the session, so just try and hold on as long as you can as you will still benefit from the effort.\n\nIn the same fashion - don't go out too hard!

These efforts are not all out max efforts, but surges above threshold, but still a controlled, aerobic effort. \n\nWe are completing two blocks of Zone 3 effort at the start of this session to generate some fatigue and give the 3 minute Zone 5 efforts much more of a 'race feel' vs doing them fresh. \n\nThe 3 minutes Z5 efforts are to be completed as much as possible, out of the saddle as we imitate a very steep single track section!",

In many gravel races the separation will occur on a hill or in loose thick gravel sections and you'll have to really put the power down to respond. \n\nThis workout will be an extended warm up including a threshold block and then into 3 blocks that you could consider climbs. I'll let you pick your RPM's for this round, but know that in a gravel race you'll likely need lower RPM's to maintain traction and because of steepness of the terrain. \n\nEnjoy!",

What I want you to do is once the interval starts I'd like you to drop your rpm's down to 60 in that big gear and let your speed drop below 10MPH. At 30 seconds you will then do a seated \"sprint\" more or less using max watts to accelerate but the catch is you won't shift and you'll gradually increase RPM's naturally as you speed up. By the end, you should be maxed, cadence and effort. If it feels easy, choose a bigger gear. I'll then want you to continue to accelerate with rpm's and speed to the finish of the minute.

We call these sessions up-and-unders, going up above and then under your long course power threshold. This session is just 1 hour 15 min in length, but can be much longer in total duration due to the relatively low intensity. Sometimes, these sessions can build up to nearly 3 hours of total work for the big timers!\n    \n    For WHOOP users \u2014 This workout is good to do on a Yellow or Green Recovery day. These up-and-under intervals have great training impacts with a lower level of strain, which is ideal for days that you haven\u2019t had decent recovery.",

		"description": "Welcome to the first bike workout in your Zwift Academy Tri journey! Specific strength is a critical component for long course triathlon. This session aims to produce large amounts of muscular force with limited disturbance to the cardiovascular systems.\n    \n    Many professional and top long course triathletes include regular endurance strength work in their training routines, and for good reason. Research has shown that training at a lower cadence produces significant power benefits compared to training at a higher cadence.\n    \n    These types of sessions are great if you\u2019ve got tired legs but still want a quality workout. This session in particular is made up of 9x4 minute reps where the cadence is kept low (65\u201355 rpm) and at a moderate intensity (between 70.3 and long course effort). If you\u2019ve ever done \"drop-sets\" in the gym, this is the cycling-specific equivalent. \n    \n    For WHOOP users \u2014 This workout is good to do on a Yellow or Green Recovery day. Due to its lower training demands, expect a lower level of strain from this session, which is ideal for days where you aren\u2019t fully recovered.",

Typically, long VO2 intervals include anything where the reps are over 1 minute in duration. They\u2019re not usually as intense as short VO2 intervals, although they should still be higher than your FTP. With these, there is more of a focus on both the anaerobic and aerobic systems. For triathletes, these are the sessions you should be including in your main training block before a competition.\n    \n    This session comes with a bit of a twist. The first minute is over FTP at 110% before settling a little lower, but still above FTP for 2 minutes. Recent studies have shown that intervals with variable intensity have a greater training effect than maintaining just one level of intensity all the way through.\n    \n    For WHOOP users - This workout is ideally done on a Green Recovery day. VO2max sessions are aimed to push you, and this workout is no different. If you aren\u2019t well recovered, get some rest and tackle this workout on another day.",

Moreover, this variable intensity has been proven to be effective at pushing thresholds up. This session also allows you to become more proficient at removing lactate and using it as a fuel during the lower intensity efforts - key to recovering after surging over the Flint Hills!

This session stresses this system and helps you develop stronger as we push your heart rate and oxygen consumption rates to a high level. \n\t\t\n\tVO2 max is not a single power number but a physiological state that equates to the amount of oxygen a person can utilize during intense exercise.

This progression allows us to sustain prolonged levels closer to our VO2 max, versus shorter/higher-powered efforts. \n\t\t\n\tWe do 3x 8min ON/OFF blocks, increasing from 20, 30, to 40sec 'On' while reducing the 'Off' durations.

We do this by starting with a 5min maximal effort before a short rest, we then move into two 15min aerobic ramps that make sure you are fatigued going into another maximal 5min effort. The x2 15min aerobic ramps in the middle of the workout is to allow you to carry some fatigue into the last capacity 5min interval and see how you perform at the end of a hard session. The key for this session is to give it your maximum in the x2 5min Free Ride sections and to maintain the wattage targets during the 15min ramps.\n    \n    You will need excellent fueling and good glycogen stores to be able to complete these efforts to the best of your ability.

This session is all about building the duration of time spent riding at an effort level close to your VO2 Max, which we'll explain.\n\n    When exercising, your heart and lungs work hard to pump oxygenated red blood cells in your body to your muscle tissue. The more oxygen your body can use, the more your muscles can work. VO2 Max is the maximum amount of oxygen your body can use.

You'll work various energy systems and find it a challenging session on the body and mind.  The session comprises of 3 main intervals: Over / Under Interval - This is to be ridden at a power just below your FTP, however for the first 30 seconds of the interval (and after every 2 minutes) you are required to spike the power closer to your 20-minute power. This interval is often referred to as a redline session, where you literally 'push' your FTP up from below, and 'pull' it up from above.  30 / 30 Interval These are 30 second on and 30 seconds off. The \"on\" element is to be ridden at your Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP) or the power at your VO2max. Whilst the \"off\" element isn't a full recovery, aiming for mid-zone 2. You will find that perhaps the hardest part of this interval is the \"off\" periods towards the end of the 12 minutes. Micro-Burst Interval  To finish the session, this interval is 15-seconds all-out followed by 30-seconds of recovery. The sprints are seated and high cadence try and maintain a maximal effort from the first 10 seconds to the last 10 seconds of the interval. Note- Some smart-trainers in their ERG mode will be too slow to react to the changes in powers required for this session and you may find it easier to turn the erg. function off.",

This test is intended to set your training zones for the duration of the academy and aid us in our selection process for the next stages of the competition. This test is best carried out with a power meter or smart trainer, however a heart rate monitor will suffice, if you do not have access to one. The test starts with a long, progressive warm up followed by some activation work, designed to prime you for the upcoming effort. The warm-up is a vital component to this test and will enable you to perform at the optimum capacity.  On completion of the warm up, it's time for the test! Simply, go as hard as you can for 20 minutes. ERG mode will turn off for the 20 min segment. You're on your own. Pace yourself throughout, trying not to go too hard, too soon but finish with an empty tank, all out. Ensure a good warm down after the test and put your feet up.",

You'll burn a lot of matches as you progress through the session, so just try and hold on as long as you can as you will still benefit from the effort.\n\nIn the same fashion - don't go out too hard! This is a fairly long session, so in the first block, just do what you need to do, 140% of FTP and no more.\n",

As the intensity goes up, the volume goes down so this session is definitely manageable and is a nice building block rather than leaving you totally exhausted for tomorrow. \n\nThe first block will alternate between your chosen cadence and a low cadence of 65rpm.",

This is to give the session a strength endurance focus - ensuring we get used to producing not only high power, but also high crank torque, to support us in those sections of a mountain bike race where we have to momentarily freewheel, and are asked to produce huge crank torque from 0rpm!\n\nWe stimulate lactic acid production during the 'over' efforts, and we then try to recover, whilst still producing a moderate effort during the 'under' phase.

This is one of the key differences between road riding and mountain bike - the constant change in effort. Even riding up a steady gradient, on a mountain bike your power will vary significantly as you navigate over and around rocks, roots, and other obstacles!\n\nThis session aims to further develop your ability to make these changes in effort more comfortably.

You will likely produce a fairly erratic pedaling style as your power output varies significantly from pedal stroke to pedal stroke!\n\nYou will notice the second block of efforts is a lot harder, as we will have the first block of efforts already in our legs - plus the 10 minute aerobic effort too.\n",
