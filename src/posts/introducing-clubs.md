We are thrilled to announce the latest feature in our workout app: **Clubs**! This exciting addition is designed to elevate your fitness journey by connecting you with like-minded athletes, offering a sense of community, and adding a fun, competitive edge to your workouts.

## What are Clubs?

Clubs are groups within our app that bring users together based on shared interests, fitness goals, or geographic location. Whether you’re looking to join a local running group, connect with fellow cyclists, or participate in club events, Clubs provide a space for you to find and interact with others who share your passion for fitness.

## Key Features of Clubs

### Connect with Others

Joining a Club allows you to connect with other athletes who have similar interests and goals. Share your progress, exchange tips, and motivate each other to reach new heights. Building relationships within the fitness community has never been easier!

### Discover New Athletes

With Clubs, you can discover new athletes to follow and get inspired by their journeys. Whether you're a seasoned athlete or just starting out, there’s always someone to learn from and share your experiences with.

### Participate in Scheduled Events

Clubs offer a variety of scheduled events that you can join. From weekly group runs to timed workouts, there’s always something happening to keep you engaged and motivated. These events are a great way to stay active and push your limits.

### Track Your Progress Together

Keep track of your progress alongside your clubmates. Compare stats, celebrate milestones, and encourage each other through every step of your fitness journey. The collective energy of a Club can be a powerful motivator!
